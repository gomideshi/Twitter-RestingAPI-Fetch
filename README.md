## Resting API Fetch

Description: a brief exercise in Python to pull tweets from Twitter's resting API using OAuth2 and Httplib2. If it is necessary to plot content on a map, Tweets can be screened for 'geo_enabled' coordinates.

### Notes

Fetch calls to the API are monitored, and [rate limiting does take place](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting). Users are expected to understand these before going 'naners.
